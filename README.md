# Razer-Blade-Stealth-Developer-Setup-2018

This year I decided I wanted to try out something other than the tired combination of Macbook + Chrome. The idea of using Windows didn't really sound appealing to me so I settled on using Ubunutu. After searching around for a good laptop, I came across the Razer Blade Stealth. It is an aluminum unibody laptop with a QHD display and some pretty awesome hardware specs. The look and feel of it reminds me of a Macbook. It doesn't feel cheap but it doesn't have the Apple tax.

## Installing Ubuntu

As with any time you setup an open source operating system, you will sometimes run into bugs. This was exactly my experience with the RBS. The two biggest issues I ran into were the caps lock key crashing my OS and the screen flickering.
