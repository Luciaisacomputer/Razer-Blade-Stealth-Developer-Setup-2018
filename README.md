# Razer-Blade-Stealth-Developer-Setup-2018

This year I decided I wanted to try out something other than the tired combination of Macbook + Chrome. The idea of using Windows didn't really sound appealing to me so I settled on using Ubunutu. After searching around for a good laptop, I came across the Razer Blade Stealth. It is an aluminum unibody laptop with a QHD display and some pretty awesome hardware specs. The look and feel of it reminds me of a Macbook. It doesn't feel cheap but it doesn't have the Apple tax.
